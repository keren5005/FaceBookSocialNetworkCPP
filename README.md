# Face-book: A Simple Social Network Simulation (C++)

**Face-book** is a basic social network simulation written in C++. This project aims to demonstrate object-oriented programming principles and concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and file handling. It simulates a simplified social network system where members can connect with each other, create statuses, and interact with fan pages.

## Features

- **Members:** Registered members can add friends, create statuses, and view the latest statuses of their friends.
- **Fan Pages:** Business pages can be created, and members can become fans of these pages.
- **Status Types:** The system supports three types of statuses - text, image, and video.
- **User-Friendly Menu:** An interactive menu guides users through different actions.
- **Operator Overloading:** Implementations of operators `+`, `<`, `==`, and `!=` for adding friends, comparing entities, and comparing statuses.
- **Exception Handling:** Robust exception handling to manage unexpected inputs.
- **Data Storage:** The system saves and loads data from a file to maintain user and entity information between program runs.

## Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (C++11 or later)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-book-cpp.git
   ```

2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ -o face-book face-book.cpp
   ```

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./face-book
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the "Face-book" simulation.

## Example Usage

1. Add friends to your network.
2. Create a fan page or become a fan of existing fan pages.
3. Post statuses (text, image, or video).
4. View statuses from friends or fan pages.
5. Compare entities or statuses.
6. Save your data when exiting the program.
